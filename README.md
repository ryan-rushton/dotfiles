My dotfiles

## Mac

Pretty straight forward, the installer script should do everything needed.

## Windows

The only manual step needed after the install script has run is to install the font into settings. To do this

- Go to `Settings -> Personalisation -> Fonts`
- Click `Browse and install fonts`
- Get desired `ttf` font files from `$HOME\scoop\apps\<font>\current`
- Restarting terminals and or vscode should now use the desired fonts.
